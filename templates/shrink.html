          <p>Shrink is a major threat for Tesco as a business. The definition is "a loss that cannot be accounted for". There
                    are
                    many reasons that can cause shrink and as people with an interest in the business tracking, monitiring and
                    solving shrink
                    issues is the best way we can combat this. This app is a simple to use, user driven app to help track shrink
                    threats, store
                    solved issues and view history to help us keep on top of it using a MongoDB database

                The App relies on us which is why its so important. Knowing what your shrink is and what its history is, is the
                first step to success.
