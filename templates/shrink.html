                                <p>Shrink is a major threat for Tesco as a business. The definition is "a loss that cannot be accounted for". There
                                    are
                                    many reasons that can cause shrink and as people with an interest in the business tracking, monitiring and
                                    solving shrink
                                    issues is the best way we can combat this. This app is a simple to use, user driven app to help track shrink
                                    threats, store solved issues and view history to help us keep on top of it using a MongoDB database</p>

                The App relies on us which is why its so important. Knowing what your shrink is and what its history is, is the
                first step to success.
